Basic Arithmetic Operations: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clear Functionality

Simple User Interface: An intuitive layout for easy use.

Error Handling: Basic handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).

üöÄ Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The core programming language.

tkinter (or specify your GUI library): Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating the graphical interface. If you used a different library like PyQt5, Kivy, or PySimpleGUI, please replace tkinter accordingly.

üßë‚Äçüíª Usage
To run the calculator, navigate to the project directory and execute the Python script:
